# Image-Resizer-C-
Windows App that resizes pictures using WPF and MagicScalar.
Mostly for resizing images for use in my web projects since jpeg quality is hard coded to 75% at the moment.
Resizing is done in parallel so it is pretty fast to resize your entire folder for usage as thumbnails or something.

# Usage
Clone the solution and build it in Visual Studio.
Resized images will be saved in pictures/resizedPictures.
The default mode cover(Max) will preserve aspect ratio by changing one of the dimensions usually the smaller one.
